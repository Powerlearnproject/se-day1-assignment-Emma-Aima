Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Pioneering Days (1940s-1950s)
2. The Birth of High-Level Languages (1950s-1960s)
3. Structured Programming and Methodologies (1970s-1980s)

1. The Pioneering Days (1940s-1950s): This era was characterized by manual programming, with programmers writing machine learning instructions. Early computers were large and complex, and software development was highly technical.
2. The Birth of High-Level Languages (1950s-1960s): High-level programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL was developed and they made programming more accessible and efficient. The programmers were allowed to wrote code that was closer to human language, reducing the complexity of software development.
3. Structured Programming and Methodologies (1970s-1980s): The development of software development methodologies, such as waterfall model, provided a structured framework for managing software projects. Strucutred programming techniques, and modular design and top-down programming, were introduced to improve code organization and maintainability.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning
2. Requirement Analysis
3. Design
4. Implementation (Coding)
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

1. Planning: This initial phase involves defining the project's scope, goals, and feasibility. It also includes tasks like project planning, resource allocation, and risk assessment.
2. Requirement Analysis: In this phase, the project team gathers and analyzes the requirements of the software. This involves understanding the needs of the stakeholders and documenting the functional and non-functional requirements.
3. Design: This phase focuses on designing the software architecture, user interface, and database. It involves creating detailed specifications that guide the development process.
4. Implemetation (Coding): This is where the actual coding takes place, translating the design into functional software. The developers write the code according to the design specifications.
5. Testing: This phase involves rigorously testing the software to identify and fix any defects or bugs. Various testing techniques are used, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
6. Deployment: Once the software has been thoroughly tested, it is deployed to the production environment. This involves installing and configuring the software for end-users.
7. Maintenance: This ongoing phase involves providing support, updates, and bug fixes to the software. It ensures that the software continues to meet the needs of the users and remains functional over a long period of time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: 
1. In characteristics, for linear and sequential, each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance) is completed before the next phase begins. Also, the Changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed. It is best suitable for projects with well-defined and stable requirements. 
2. In approriate scenarios, the projects where changes are costly or difficult, the physical infrastructure component relies on software. The projects with fixed requirements such as large-scale government projects or systems comes with strict regulatory compliance which uses the method of waterfall.
Agile Methodology:
1. In characteristics, it adapts to changing requirements throughout the development process, the development process is broken down into short "sprints" or iterations. It is best suitable for projects with evolving requirements or where early feedback is crucial.
2. In appropriate scenarios, this agile methodology can be used when developing a new web application or mobile app, it can also be used where speed and adaptability of project is crucial, and it is used to derive customer's feedback like deveoping a user-friendly product.

The Difference Between Agile and Waterfall are as follows:
1. In flexibility: agile is highly flexible, while waterfall is rigid.
2. For change of management: agile embraces changes, while waterfall resists changes.
3. In customer involvement: agile has continuous involvement, while waterfall has limited involvement.
4. For risk management: agile mitigates risks throughout the project, while waterfall often discovers risks late in the project.
5. For developing styles: agile is iterative, while waterfall is sequential.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Artfificial Intelligence is (AI) is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. The abilities include;
a. Learning: Adapting and improving from experience.   
b. Reasoning: Solving problems and making logical decisions.   
c. Problem-solving: Finding solutions to complex issues.   
d. Perception: Understanding and interpreting sensory input (like seeing or hearing).   
e. Language understanding: Processing and generating human language.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is essentially the process of designing and refining input prompts to elicit desired outputs from artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs). 
Importance in interacting with AI models.
1. They guide the AI, LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data, enabling them to generate human-like text, but they require specific guidance to produce relevant and accurate results. Prompt engineering provides that guidance.
2. They craft effective prompts, the goal is to optimize the prompt to ensure the AI understands the intended task and generates the desired output.
3. They provide clear and specific instructions that is crucial for guiding the AI towards the desired outcome.
4. They add relevant context and background information which helps the AI understand the task and to generate more accurate and meaningful responses.
5. Providing examples or demonstrations can help the AI understand the desired format and style of the output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
"Write something interesting" This vague prompt doesn't describe or say anything specific to the AI agents. In order, to derive a good result from the AI agent, it has to be clear, specific and concise. For example, the prompt can be changes to this, "Write a play describing how a family of four went for grocery shopping on a saturday, stating the various items they bought from the supermarket" or "Write a rap song lyric with a tint of reggae mix and let the topic be about a falling government economy" 
The improved prompt is more effective because it is more dscriptive, specific, clear and concise, it helps the AI agent to deliver a more suitable response or result to the user. It is advised to always use the about techniques while giving commands to the AI agents to receive a better looking results. 
Thank you!
